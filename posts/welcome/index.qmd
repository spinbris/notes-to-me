This is my public notebook created in Quarto after seeing all the recent webinars from the amazing people at RStudio (eg JJ Allaire, Tom Mock and Isabella Velasquez)

It is intended that it will contain public 'Notes to Myself' on some of my interests which professionally are likely to centre on things like:

-   R Programming

-   Python Programming

-   ML analytics in R and Python

-   Finance and data analytics (my day job)

-   Other analytics and notes collected from wherever

Not sure that it will be much use to anyone else, but feel free to wander through.
