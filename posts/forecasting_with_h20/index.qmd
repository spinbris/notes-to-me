## Introduction

This analysis is one part of a multi-part set of posts looking at forecasting on domestic Australian flight volumes by route in the period prior to when covid largely shut the industry down. Its intention is just to provide me with examples over the main models to save time on future projects.It is split into:

1.  Some pre analysis (basic EDA analysis is not covered as already included in previous posts)

2.  'Sequence' style models - ARIMA etc

3.  ML style models - XGBoost etc including nesting and ensembling

4.  Deep learning models (GLuonTS etc)

5.  Summary of conclusions

This post is in relation to the part 4 - focussing on H20, usimg the modeltime package to connect. This post is actually using ML models, but will be expanded to include deep learning approaches

it uses the modeltime H20 [documentation](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.h2o/articles/getting-started.html)

## Load Libraries

```{r, libraries}
library(tidymodels)
library(modeltime.h2o)
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
```

## Load Data

All data is loaded, except Brisbane-Emerald route is excluded as it caused problems, probably due to lack of data.

The top 10 routes are shown in order of overall patronage

```{r, data}

top_x   <- 10
start   <- "2001-01-01"
end     <- "2019-07-01"
horizon <-  "1 year"

top_routes_prep_df <- read_rds("./artifacts/top_routes_prep_df.rds") %>%  
  filter(route != "BRISBANE-EMERALD") %>% #dodgy for some reason
  #rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  select(date,route,passenger_trips)

topx <- top_routes_prep_df %>% 
  group_by(route) %>% 
  summarise(passenger_trips = sum(passenger_trips)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  slice_max(passenger_trips, n=top_x) %>% 
  arrange(desc(passenger_trips)) %>% 
  select(route) %>% 
  pull() %>% 
  as.character()

topx %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Graph Plots for top routes (to save space)

These graphs include full history. Covid period will be excluded for future analysis (bit hard to predict that little black swan).

```{r, graph,fig.width=10,fig.height=15}


top_routes_prep_df %>% 
  filter(route %in% topx) %>%
  group_by(route) %>% 
  plot_time_series(
    .date_var    = date,
    .value       = passenger_trips/1000,
    .facet_ncol  = 2,
    .smooth      = F,
    .interactive = F,
    .title       = "Passenger Trips(000) by Route"
  )

```

## Split data

Data filtered to targetted period and then is split into trainig and test sets. Test set is 12 months.

```{r, split}


data_tbl <- top_routes_prep_df %>% 
  filter(date %>% between_time(start,end))
  

splits <- time_series_split(data_tbl, assess = horizon, cumulative = TRUE)

recipe_spec <- recipe(passenger_trips ~ ., data = training(splits)) %>%
    step_timeseries_signature(date) 

train_tbl <- training(splits) %>% bake(prep(recipe_spec), .)
test_tbl  <- testing(splits)  %>% bake(prep(recipe_spec), .)

#min(test_tbl$date)
splits

```

## Connect to H20

```{r, h2o}

# Initialize H2O
h2o.init(
    nthreads = -1,
    ip       = 'localhost',
    port     = 54321
)
# Optional - Set H2O No Progress to remove progress bars
h2o.no_progress()

```

## Set up Model Specification

```{r, model_spec}

model_spec <- automl_reg(mode = 'regression') %>%
    set_engine(
         engine                     = 'h2o',
         max_runtime_secs           = 60*60, 
         max_runtime_secs_per_model = 60,
         max_models                 = 10,
         nfolds                     = 5,
         #exclude_algos              = c("DeepLearning"),
         verbosity                  = NULL,
         seed                       = 786
    ) 

model_spec


```

## Train and Fit

```{r, train}

model_fitted <- model_spec %>%
    fit(passenger_trips ~ ., data = train_tbl)

model_fitted 

```

## Leaderboard

```{r, leaderboard}

leaderboard_tbl <- automl_leaderboard(model_fitted) 

leaderboard_tbl %>% knitr::kable()

```

So AutoML and stacked ensembles thereof lead the way, deep learning approaches not really ranking!

Now,

```{r,modeltime_table}

modeltime_tbl <- modeltime_table(
    model_fitted
) 

modeltime_tbl


```

## Calibrate - test data

```{r,calibration_tbl}

calibration_tbl <- modeltime_tbl %>%
  modeltime_calibrate(
    new_data = test_tbl,
    id      = "route")

forecast_test_tbl <- calibration_tbl %>% 
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data    = test_tbl,
        actual_data = data_tbl,
        keep_data   = TRUE,
        conf_by_id  = T
    ) %>%
    group_by(route)

#calibration_tbl

```

## Graph Forecast - Top 10 Routes

Using the top model in the leaderboard- Auto_ML Stacked Ensemble

```{r,calibration_graph,fig.width=10,fig.height=15}

forecast_test_tbl %>%
  filter(route %in% topx,
         lubridate::year(date)> 2015) %>% 
    plot_modeltime_forecast(
        .facet_ncol = 2, 
        .interactive = T,
        .title = "Forecast v Test Data - top 10 Routes"
    )



```

So forecasts look pretty good...

## Accuracy

Another look at accuracy measures of top model only.

```{r, accuracy}

calibration_tbl %>% 
  modeltime_accuracy(metric_set = extended_forecast_accuracy_metric_set()) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

## Refit to full Dataset

Before doing any predictions, we need to refit model to full dataset (train and test), so that prediction is based on most recent data!

```{r, refit}

data_prepared_tbl <- bind_rows(train_tbl, test_tbl)

future_tbl <- data_prepared_tbl %>%
    group_by(route) %>%
    future_frame(.date_var   = date,
                 .length_out = "1 year") %>%
    ungroup()

future_prepared_tbl <- bake(prep(recipe_spec), future_tbl)

refit_tbl <- calibration_tbl %>%
    modeltime_refit(data_prepared_tbl)


```

## Prediction

```{r, pred, graph_pred,fig.width=10,fig.height=15}

prediction <- refit_tbl %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data    = future_prepared_tbl,
        actual_data = data_prepared_tbl,
        keep_data   = TRUE,
        conf_by_id  = T
    ) %>%
    group_by(route) 

prediction %>% 
  filter(route %in% topx,
         lubridate::year(date)> 2015) %>% 
  plot_modeltime_forecast(
        .facet_ncol  = 2,
        .interactive = T,
        .title       = "Passenger Trip Prediction - top 10 Routes"
        
    )


```

I could compare the above prediction to the actuals, and i did on the base analyses, but it is a bit pointless due to the covid cliff, which is not in the analysis. Might include it as/if data is updated and some normality resumes.

## Save Model and Close H2o connection

```{r, save_close}

model_fitted %>% 
  save_h2o_model(path = "./artifacts/h20_model1", overwrite = TRUE)

#model_h2o <- load_h2o_model(path = "./artifacts/h20_model1")

#h2o.shutdown(prompt = FALSE)

```
